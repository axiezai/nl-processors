Datasets:

The datasets might be too big for Github repos to host, so I'm putting links here instead, but can potentially save smaller data chunks here for testing.

### Files:
 - `studyforrest_german_transcript.csv` - This transcript contains all information on the audio-movie content that cannot be inferred from the DVD release â€” in a plain text, comma-separated-value table. Start and end time stamp, as well as the spoken text are provided for each continuous audio description segment.
